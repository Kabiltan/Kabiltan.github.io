                <h2 class="paragraph">Description</h2> 
                <article>This project is a web application that allows users to test their knowledge of Pokemon names. Users are shown a picture of a pokemon and four
                    name options. The game continues until users answer a question wrong. My motivation behind this project was to learn more about database managment, specifially
                    MySQL databases. I played pokemon games a lot as a kid so I wanted to see how well I could recall the names of pokemon.

                    <p style="float: right;">This project was centered around storing and querying data in a MySQL database. As of today(3/20/2021) there are 698 pokemon. Instead
                        of manually adding each pokemon's picture and name into the database, I wrote a web-scrapper script in python that would scrap the neccessary information I needed
                        off of an existing website and store it in the database.

                    <p style="float: left;"> For this project, I wrote the frontend using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. For the backend I used a web framework called Flask which
                        I wrote the code for in Python and a MySQL database that stores the picture and name of each pokemon. The backend of this website handles and processes
                        the requests made by the user on the frontend such as determinig if a user selected the correct pokemon name for the picture being displayed.
